# maitreya.aic

## What is it?
An interactive SCP story.

This repository contains compiled builds which are available here:

* [Windowed](https://croque-scp.github.io/maitreya/dist/)
* [Fullscreen](https://croque-scp.github.io/maitreya/dist/maitreya.html)

## Building
In order to build Maitreya from source you will need Git, Node.js and Gulp.js
installed.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/rossjrw/maitreya.git
cd maitreya
npm install
gulp
xdg-open dist/index.html
```
This will compile and open Maitreya in a browser.

index.html provides a resizable iframe for testing different screen sizes,
which contains maitreya.html. maitreya.html is the content of the article, and
fills the iframe if accessed through index.html or the Wikidot page, or the
whole screen if accessed by itself.

`src/js/LoopService.coffee` is a file generated by a spreadsheet on Google
Sheets. Please contact me if you require access to this spreadsheet (it will be
very useful for translations).
