# The game state tracks all the variables throughout the course of the
# game.

# State variables must be one of the following:

# A flag (flag). Used to track if a certain thing has happened.
# A counter (integer). Use to track how many times a certain thing has
# happened.
# A key (string). Used to track which of a set of things is currently
# happening.
# A value (float). Used to track values which accept changes of varying
# magnitudes. Imprecise.

# Player states persist forever; saved to local/remote storage
